# ZZZP (转转转盘)

ZhuanZhuanZhuanPan AKA ZZZP (转转转盘) is an Android application where you can use a "wheel of fortune" to make a decision. For instance, you can type in names several different restaurants if you are not sure which one to choose for a lunch. Manually slide the screen to make the wheel run. Also, your options will be saved for your next use.
